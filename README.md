Crypto Trends is a test project showcasing a SwiftUI cryptocurrency trends application.

### Functionality
- The app displays the top 250 cryptocurrencies worldwide along with market statistics.
- Users can search for coins, sort them, and reload the data.
- Upon selecting a coin, users can view its statistics and price chart.
- The app uses Combine to fetch data and bind UI components reactively.
- Downloaded coin images are stored in the cache directory using FileManager.
- Users can select and add coins to their portfolio (wallet). Coin storage is implemented using Core Data.
- The app follows the MVVM pattern for clear separation of concerns.

# CoinGecko API ü¶é
CryptoTrends uses the [CoinGecko](https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/introduction) to fetch the coins.
